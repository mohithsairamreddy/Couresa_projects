    	              <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the

                        incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others,

                        establishing a "pecking order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and


                        nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this

                        social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an

                        existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[19] When a rooster finds food, he may call other

                        chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping

                        the food. This behavior may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them
                        to eat..</p>

    	              <p>Meat and meat products constitute important source of protein, fat, and several functional compounds. Although beef consumption may implicate possible negative impacts on human health,

                           its consumption can also contribute to human health. Quality traits of beef, as well as its nutritional properties, depend on animal genetics, feeding, livestock practices, and post m

                           ortem procedures. Available data show that emerging beef production systems are able to improve both, quality and nutritional traits of beef in a sustainable way. In this context, 

                           Argentinaâ€™s actions are aimed at maximising beef beneficial effects and minimising its negative impact on human health, in a way of contributing to global food security..</p>

    	              <p>For most people it is raw fish, star dish of Japanese cuisine, but is it that simple? Not at all. Sushi is actually a way to prepare rice, not raw fish with accompaniment ... 
                          
                        In fact, sushi always carries rice but it does not have to carry fish.

                        Sushi is the most famous Japanese dish outside of Japan and one of the most popular among Japanese, who enjoy sushi on special occasions.  And as such, it was evolved 
                        
                        outside that country, influenced by different Western cultures, especially in USA. That is why many of the different types of sushi have denomination of localities of USA (California roll, 
                        
                        New York roll, etc.)
                        
                        The name of sushi is a generic name of different types, combinations of ingredients and forms of a typical Japanese food, and basically are made from Japanese type rice and
                        
                        different seafood (fresh fish, prawns, seaweed etc) and vegetables..</p>
